# Dev_Node

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, I document my journey of learning Node.js while developing my own practical webstore project.

## Project Overview

These days, the repository is divided into two parts. In the first part, I began my Node.js learning journey using a JSON document to store all the data for the webstore project.

In the current phase, I have progressed to learning and implementing a MySQL database for the webstore. This part of the repository is actively updated daily as I explore and develop new features.

## About the Webstore Project

The webstore project aims to create a simple and practical online store using Node.js and a MySQL database. With this project, I aim to gain hands-on experience in various aspects of web development and deepen my understanding of Node.js and databases.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `/json-data`: Contains the initial phase of the project where I used a JSON document to store data.
- `/mysql-database`: Contains the current phase of the project where I am utilizing a MySQL database.
